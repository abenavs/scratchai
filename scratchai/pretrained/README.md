This file contains details about all the pretrained models available in scratchai.

NOTE: If link to a pretrained model is updated it will be updated in [urls.py](https://github.com/iArunava/scratchai/blob/master/scratchai/pretrained/urls.py)
first and not here. You can look for the link there by searching for `$MODEL_NAME` followed by `_url`


| Pretrained Model | Description | Link |
| :--- | :------| :--- |
| Alexnet | The weights of the pretrained model are the exact same as the one that comes with pytorch but the `keys` are different as the model implementation is different than in pytorch | [download](https://www.dropbox.com/s/hogfy6yap8an5x9/alexnet.pth?dl=1) |
